      question: "What makes PulseAgency different from other marketing agencies?",
      answer: "We combine data science, creative excellence, and strategic thinking with complete transparency. Unlike traditional agencies that hide behind vanity metrics, we focus on business outcomes: revenue, profitability, and sustainable growth. Our team includes former in-house growth leaders from companies like Meta, Google, and unicorn startups."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your typical onboarding and ramp-up timeline?",
      answer: "Week 1: Comprehensive audit and strategy development. Week 2-3: Campaign setup, creative production, and tracking implementation. Week 4+: Launch and optimization. Most clients see positive results within 30-45 days, with full optimization achieved by month 3."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with businesses in my industry?",
      answer: "We've worked with 500+ clients across SaaS, e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, B2B services, and more. Our performance marketing methodology is industry-agnostic, but we bring specific vertical expertise to every engagement through our specialized team members."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the minimum ad spend you require?",
      answer: "Our Growth plan starts at $25K monthly ad spend, Scale at $100K, and Enterprise is custom. However, we evaluate each business individually based on unit economics, LTV, and growth potential rather than just budget size."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure success and report results?",
      answer: "We provide weekly performance dashboards with real-time data, monthly strategic reviews, and quarterly business reviews. We track the metrics that matter: CAC, LTV, ROAS, revenue, and profitabilityâ€”not just clicks and impressions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you integrate with our existing tools and systems?",
      answer: "Yes. We integrate with 50+ platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, GA4, and custom data warehouses. Our analytics team can build custom integrations and data pipelines as needed for Enterprise clients."
    },
    {
      question: "What if we're already working with another agency?",
      answer: "Many of our best clients came from other agencies. We offer a complimentary audit of your current performance and can often identify 20-30% efficiency gains immediately. Transitions are seamless with our proven migration process."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer month-to-month contracts?",
      answer: "Our Growth and Scale plans require a 3-month initial commitment to allow for proper optimization. After that, they become month-to-month. Enterprise contracts are typically 12-month engagements with quarterly business reviews."
